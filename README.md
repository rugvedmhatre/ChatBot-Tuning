# ChatBot-Tuning
This repository contains code for a ChatBot trained using parameters obtained from a Weights &amp; Biases (W&amp;B) parameter sweep. The model is then profiled using PyTorch Profiler to analyze performance bottlenecks. Additionally, an optimized TorchScript version is created for efficient deployment.
